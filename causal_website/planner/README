This repository contains code for a proof of concept planner.
PDDL like code is used to define a world state, and the planner plans actions in that world.

Running the whole program starts from main.py.

Defining a specific problem domain follows the following structure. 
First implement a State subclass to contain the world state
Then write subclasses of the Action class that represent all possible actions in that world
Then simply in the init of your specific domain class (a subclass of Domain). Super an initialized state variable of your domain. Then set "your_domain"."action_name" to be the function describing an action. This hooks in the action class into the metadata of the domain and allows it to work
